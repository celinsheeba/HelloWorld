Happy birthday to the love of my life. I love you so much that words cannot express it. It is only the feelings of love, mutual respect and care that can express my true feelings for you. I can’t wait to celebrate tonight when we blow out the candles and turn out the lights. I know that you do so much to take care of the kid and me. Sometimes I forget to thank you. On this birthday, I hope I can show you how much you mean to me and how grateful I am that you are my wife. Happy Birthday dear.
